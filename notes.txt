Delete user from project.
What happens to the tasks they are assigned to?

    Created CreateTask modal. Properly creates the task and assigns the new users. Needs to be automatically loaded on the page (maybe set something in the auth to true or false every time we want a reload). TaskBox needs to be setup to render assignees. I think we should make an assignee initials component that can be easily rendered with anyone's initials and color.

    Invite user to project:
    When invite is submitted:
        create Notification
            link?
                link is the project page
        
        what if 
            projects has an array of invited users
            when invite is submitted, server finds user id by their email, adds it to the array. 
            when user follows notification link to project page, modal pops up telling them theyve been invited.
            if they accept, server removes user id from invited users of project, adds user to project through sequelize association
            if they deny, server removes user id from invited users of project, redirects them back to their home page
